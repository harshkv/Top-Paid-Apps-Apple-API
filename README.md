# Top-Paid-Apps-Apple-API 

Built an Android Application, that makes RESTful API calls to the Apple top paid applications. Performed JSON parsing on retrieved data. Displayed using custom-built ListView Adapter.

Users can long-click gesture and select applications, and add to the filtered list, which is a horizontal Recycler view.

Adding applications to the filtered list removes applications from the main list.

Deleting applications from the filtered list puts back applications to the main list.
